Queue data type will need atleast 3 methods:

enqueue-allows data to be put at the back of the queue
dequeue-removes and returns data at the front
peek-prints the data at the front

values we need to know/have:


a value for a data node
a pointer for the next node

a pointer for the front
a pointer for the back
a pointer for the newest added data node
