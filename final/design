#I plan on implementing a rather simple graph where a node can only have two adjecent nodes at maximum.

#Tests for code that it needs to pass. 

vertex's are actually added
connections between vertex's are added and can be weighted
It finds correct minimum spanning tree
It finds correct minimum distance

#Functions

created specified numbers of vertex's function
add edge function
minimum spanning tree
shortest path
been visisted function?

#use adjecency matrix probably with vector.


iterate through node * array for MST 
do the same for shortest path
