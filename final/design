#Design updated so nodes can have more and two adjecents

#Tests for code that it needs to pass. 

vertex's are actually added
connections between vertex's are added and can be weighted
It finds correct minimum spanning tree
It finds correct minimum distance

#Functions

created specified numbers of vertex's function
add edge function
minimum spanning tree
shortest path
been visisted function?

#use two vectors, one for weights of edges one for adjecent nodes.


iterate through node * array for MST 
do the same for shortest path
