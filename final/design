#Tests for code that it needs to pass. 

vertex's are actually added
connections between vertex's are added and can be weighted
It finds correct minimum spanning tree
It finds correct minimum distance

#Functions

Add vertex function
add edge function
minimum spanning tree
shortest path
been visisted function?

#use adjecency matrix probably with vector.


form queue of visited nodes for minimum spanning tree
use dijktras algorytm for shortest path
