#Tests

Check left node of the left left node to make sure nodes are added properly

Check leftmost/rightmost node to make sure when a node was removed the tree has remained intact

#Functions

Going to need add function and remove function

remove function will first find node by checking values and going to the left if the value is less or equal to current node and right if greater.

Successor will be chosen by first checking if there is a right subtree on the found node and if not, head to the very bottom of the left subtree.
if there is a right subtree head to leftmost node in the right subtree.

#Things we may need to know/have
