For a linked listed sorting and searching we will need atleast two functions:

add_sorted()

search()

For the add sorted we will need to know the values of each node added so that we can place it from lowest to highest

we can do this by checking the value of a node and see if it is higher or lower than the node we want to insert

for searching in a linked list we will need to implement a search with that linked list that goes through the list and checks the values.
