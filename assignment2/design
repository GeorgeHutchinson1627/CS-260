For a queue data structure we will likely need to following functions:

A way to check if the queue has looped all the way around
A way to add an item to the back of the queue.
A way to add an item to the beginning of the queue.
A way to pop an item from the end of the queue.
A way to see what is at the front and back of the queue.
A way to check if the queue is empty

Values we might need to know for a queue could be:

The length of the queue
How many values are currently in the queue
The value of the pointer of the beginning of the queue

For a list data structure these functions will probably be useful:

A way to insert an item anywhere in the list
A way to remove an item anywhere in the list
A way to check if there are no items in the list

Values that will be important:

The value of the item we are trying to add or remove.
The length of the list
The position of the item we are trying to insert/remove
