For a queue data structure we will likely need to following functions:

A way to check if the queue has looped all the way around
A way to add an item to the back of the queue.
A way to add an item to the beginning of the queue.
A way to pop an item from the end of the queue.
A way to see what is at the front and back of the queue.

Values we might need to know for a queue could be:

The length of the queue
How many values are currently in the queue
