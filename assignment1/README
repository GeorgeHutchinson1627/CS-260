1. Some what we could represent a marble could the marbles could be represented a an integer that in inscribed into the marble, and the bag could be an vector

2. We could add them by pushing a bunch of integers using the vector pushback function.
3.To remove marbles the vector erase function could be used to get rid of individual marbles.

4. Tests I will do are to remove all of the marbles from the vector and even try to remove more marbles than are in the bag.
   I will then add the marbles back and remove 1 marble in particular.
